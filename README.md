# Master Thesis Notes and Code
For upcoming thesis in summer 2025.

This repository contains my code for simulation of asset prices under the Heston model and OTHER numerical approximations. The code is only avaliable in python.

## Simulations
The implemented Monte Carlo simulation schemes (so far):
- Euler
- Milstein
- Truncated-Gaussian (TG)
- Quadratic-Exponential (QE)
