# Master Thesis Notes and Code
Ror upcoming thesis in summer 2025.

This repository contains my sources and self-made code for simulation of asset prices under the Heston model and numerical approximations using Carr-Madan and Heston's original formula. The code is only avaliable in python.

## Simulations
The implemented Monte Carlo simulation schemes (so far):
- Euler
- Milstein
- Truncated-Gaussian (TG)
- Quadratic-Exponential (QE)
